        <p>According to the responses, the primary feature defining sustainable fashion is <span>high quality, durable products, followed by a pollution-free production process that does not use hazardous chemicals.</span> In the two Western cities polled (London and New York), ethical and fair trade/labour practice is seen as a major component in sustainable fashion, while the three Asian cities (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo) tended to focus mostly on environmental concerns.</p>
